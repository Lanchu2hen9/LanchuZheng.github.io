    <h1>About this Page</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! If you’ve found this page it means you are interested in updates
      about my work. And thank you for checking out my work. Anyways, this page
      currently in the Figma prototype doesn’t contain much, but in the future,
      this page will be a place where I can informally document and give updates
      about my work.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My goal for this Figma prototype is to potentially code or develop my own
      website during the course of 2025. Currently speaking, there’s no big
      expectation for a fully personally coded website. Your feedback will also
      impact the future development of this website/prototype. Stay tuned for
      more details!
    </p>

    <p>
      Spacing between headings fixed. Currently still need to add a footer, and
      still need to fix the slight issue of the "on hover" tab not being the
      same size as the drop-down menu. Not the most important detail to focus
      on.
